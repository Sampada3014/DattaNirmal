    3.The Score:

<p>Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850 (though some models might have slightly different ranges). In India, CIBIL scores range from 300 to 900.</p>
<p>A higher score generally indicates a lower credit risk, making it more likely that you'll be approved for credit and receive favorable terms like lower interest rates and higher credit limits.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Very Good:</strong> 740-799
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Good:</strong> 670-739
            </li>
            <li>
